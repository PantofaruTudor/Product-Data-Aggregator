# Ecommerce Data Fetcher

A set of Python scripts designed to grab product information from fashion websites.

### Why I built this
I made this nearly 2 years ago to help with my own online clothing store. Instead of manually copying and pasting hundreds of products, I built this tool to automate the whole process.
It was tested on websites like PRM and BSTN, but can be adapted for others with some small changes.

### What it does
* **Auto-Fetching:** Grabs product names, prices, and high-quality image URLs.
* **Data Formatting:** Converts messy website data into clean JSON or CSV files that are ready to be uploaded.
* **Speed:** What used to take hours of manual work now happens in seconds.

### Tech Stack
* **Python**
* **Requests / BeautifulSoup**
* **JSON/CSV** for storage

### Small Dissavantages
* You need to give a list of URL's to fetch data from.
